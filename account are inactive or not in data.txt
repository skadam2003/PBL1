The bank manager has decided to mark all those accounts as inactive (I) on which there are no
transactions performed in last 365 days. Whenever any such update takes place a record for the
same is maintained in the INACT_MASTER_TABLE comprising of the account number, the
opening date and type of account. Write PL/SQL code block to do the same(cursor for loop) 


DECLARE
  CURSOR c_accounts IS
    SELECT account_number, opening_date, account_type
    FROM ACCOUNT_MASTER;
BEGIN
  FOR rec IN c_accounts LOOP
    -- Check if there are any transactions in the last 365 days
    BEGIN
      SELECT COUNT(*)
      INTO v_transaction_count
      FROM TRANSACTIONS
      WHERE account_number = rec.account_number
      AND transaction_date >= SYSDATE - 365;
      
      IF v_transaction_count = 0 THEN
        -- No transactions in the last 365 days, mark account as inactive
        UPDATE ACCOUNT_MASTER
        SET account_status = 'I'
        WHERE account_number = rec.account_number;
        
        -- Insert record in INACT_MASTER_TABLE
        INSERT INTO INACT_MASTER_TABLE (account_number, opening_date, account_type)
        VALUES (rec.account_number, rec.opening_date, rec.account_type);
        
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Account marked as inactive: ' || rec.account_number);
      END IF;
      
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
