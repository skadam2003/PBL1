a) Consider following database schema and solve given queries
cust_mstr(cust_no,fname,lname)
add_dets(code_no,add1,add2,state,city,pincode)
1. Create above Tables with suitable data
2. Retrieve the address of customer Fname as 'xyz' and Lname as 'pqr'
3. Create View on add_dets table by selecting any two columns and perform insert 
update delete operations
b) Create following Tables
emp_mstr(e_mpno,f_name,l_name,m_name,dept,desg,branch_no)
branch_mstr(name,b_no)
List the employee details along with branch names to which they belong 


2.SELECT add1, add2, state, city, pincode
FROM add_dets
WHERE code_no IN (
  SELECT cust_no
  FROM cust_mstr
  WHERE fname = 'xyz' AND lname = 'pqr'
);


3.-- Create the view
CREATE VIEW add_dets_view AS
SELECT code_no, add1, city
FROM add_dets;

-- Insert operation on the view
INSERT INTO add_dets_view (code_no, add1, city) VALUES (4, 'New Address', 'New City');

-- Update operation on the view
UPDATE add_dets_view SET add1 = 'Updated Address' WHERE code_no = 4;

-- Delete operation on the view
DELETE FROM add_dets_view WHERE code_no = 4;


b).

SELECT e.e_mpno, e.f_name, e.l_name, e.m_name, e.dept, e.desg, b.name AS branch_name
FROM emp_mstr e
JOIN branch_mstr b ON e.branch_no = b.b_no;
