Consider following Bank database schema and solve given queries:
Account(Acc_no, branch_name,balance)
branch(branch_name,branch_city, assets)
customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city)
Depositor(cust_name,acc_no)
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount)
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no)
Q.1 Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key constrains, not
null etc. with suitable data
Q.2. Modify “assets” attribute of branch table to “Property” 
Q.3. Find all loan numbers for loans made at Akurdi Branch with loan amount > 12000.
Q.4. Find all customers who have both account and loan at bank.
Q.5. Find all customer who have account but no loan at the bank.
Q.6. Find the average account balance at each branch
Q.7. Find the branches where average account balance > 12000.
Q.8. Find number of tuples in customer relation.
Q.9. Calculate total loan amount given by bank.
Q.10. Delete all loans with loan amount between 1300 and 1500.
Q.11. Create sequence roll_seq and use in student table for roll_no column.
