create a row level trigger for the CUSTOMERS table that would fire for INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE
operations performed on the CUSTOMERS table. This trigger will display the salary difference between the old
values and new values


CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER customers_salary_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  salary_diff NUMBER;
BEGIN
  IF INSERTING OR UPDATING THEN
    salary_diff := :NEW.salary - :OLD.salary;
  ELSIF DELETING THEN
    salary_diff := -1 * :OLD.salary;
  END IF;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary difference: ' || salary_diff);
END;
